# SALES-ANALYSIS-DASHBOARD
My first end-to-end Power BI project covering data transformation, modeling, DAX, interactive dashboards, and AI-powered visualizations.
This repository showcases my first complete Power BI project, covering all the core concepts and hands-on assignments I completed while learning data analysis and visualization in Power BI. The project walks through the full lifecycle of building a report â€” from data preparation to modeling, DAX calculations, dashboard design, and AI-powered insights.
